# RedSquirrelNFT

This repository is a sample Non-Fungible Token project written for the Flow Blockchain. The contract is based on Flow's [ExampleNFT](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/master/contracts/ExampleNFT.cdc).

To run the tests, navigate to the `lib/go/cadence_test` directory and run `go test -v`. 

A link to the companion blog post that includes setup instructions will be coming soon.
